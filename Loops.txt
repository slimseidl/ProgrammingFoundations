	1. Loop Basics
		a. Executes loops statements when true
			i. When false
				1) Executes next action
		b. Each pass is called an iteration
		c. Continues until statement is false
		d. Can be used to compute an average of a group of numbers
		e. Statements execute one at a time
			i. Use a loop to examine a list of values one at a time and update variables along the way
				1) Common in programming
		f. Count specific values in a list
			i. Negative numbers
			ii. Positive numbers
			iii. End with a specific value
		g. Finding the max value
	2. Getting input before a loop
		a. Can use input in two places
			i. Beginning  before loop
			ii. Loop Body End
	3. Loop Expressions
		a. Relational operators can be used in a loop
			i. Loop will execute as long as x > y
				1) Or x < y
			ii. Executed as long as 
				1) X != y
	4. Common Errors with Loops
		a. Using the opposite relation operator than desired
			i. X ==0 instead of x != 0
		b. Infinite Loops
			i. Indefinite false
			ii. Forgetting to update a variable
		c. Remember to update needed variables at the end of a loop body
	5. More Loop Examples
		a. Calculating greatest common denominator
			i. Looping values until the numbers are equal
		b. Input until sentinel
			i. Sentinel value
				1) A value indicating the end of the list
	6. Looping N Times
		a. Loops commonly run a specified number of times
			i. 3 Parts:
				1) Variable initialization before loop
				2) Decision statement
				3) Loop variable update
		b. Finding the Max
			i. Analyzing data
			ii. Updating to a max seen so far in the list until all iterations are ran
	7. A loop can start with a negative value
	8. While and for loops
		a. While
			i. Repeatedly iterates loop body while expression is true
		b. For
			i. Specific number of times executed
			ii. Use when number of times is known
	9. Nested Loops
		a. Loop that appears in the body of another loop
			i. Inner loop
		b. Outer loop is the first loop
	10. Do while loops
		a. Executes loop body before checking the condition
	11. Code "For" Loops
		a. For (variable initialization); condition; variable update
			i. Separated 3 sections with a semicolon
		b. Body
			i. Indented from first "for" statement
	12. Swapping two variables
		a. Swapping x to y and y to x
			i. Typically uses a third variable
		b. Swap Arrays
			i. Swap outermost
				1) Then next outermost
					a) Until middle is reached
	13. Code for Arrays
		a. Integer array(size) x 
		b. Elements
			i. Value[0] 
			ii. Value[1]
				1) Etcâ€¦.
