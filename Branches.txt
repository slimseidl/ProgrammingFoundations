	1. Branches
		a. Branch
			i. Sequence of statements ran under a certain condition
		b. Decision
			i. Creates two branches
				1) Like an if statement
				2) If decisions expression is true
					a) 1st branch executes else 2nd branch 
			ii. Diamond Symbol in flow chart
		c. If-Else with two branches
			i. If statement is true
				1) True branch executes
				2) Else false branch runs
			ii. Only one branch can execute
			iii. True or False
		d. If Else - Max Value
			i. If X > y 
				1) X = max
					a) Else y = max
		e. If Else If Branches
			i. Branches can have branches and decisions within it 
				1) If years == 1 
					a) Put newlyweds
				2) Elseif years == 25 
					a) Put silver
				3) Elseif year == 50 
					a) Put Golden
				4) Else
					a) Put Congrats
		f. Multiple If
			i. Each decision is independent
				1) More than one branch can execute
		g. Equality operators
			i. Checks if values are the same
				1) ==
			ii. Or Different
				1) !=
			iii. Evals to a boolean
				1) True or false
			iv. A == B
				1) A is equal to B 
			v. A != B 
				1) A is not equal to B
		h. Relational Operator
			i. >, <, >=, <=
		i. Detecting Ranges using Branches
			i. U8
				1) Under 8
					a) Excludes 1-5
					b) 6, 7
				2) U10
					a) 8, 9
		j. Cascading Decisions
			i. Second decision only considered if the first decision is false
		k. Logical Operators
			i. And, Or, Not
			ii. And
				1) Both are true
			iii. Or
				1) One is true
			iv. Not
				1) Opposite
			v. Commonly found in decision expressions
		l. Order of Evaluations
			i. Parentheses
			ii. Not
				1) / % + -
				2) <, >, <=, >=
				3) == !=
				4) And
				5) Or
			iii. Use parentheses where possible to avoid common mistakes and confusion
		m. Floating Point Comparison
			i. Do not use == operator
				1) Due to precision of float
			ii. Compare for close enough rather than exact
				1) Thresholds
					a) .00001 is common
					b) Called Epsilon
				2) If abs((X - Y)) < 0.0001
					a) Considered equal
		n.  Code: Branches
			i. In code, statements use an "if"
