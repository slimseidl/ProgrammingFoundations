	1. Programming
		a. Requires extreme attention to detail
		b. Three phases
			i. Inputs
				1) Program gets data
			ii. Process
				1) Computations on Data
			iii. Outputs
				1) Displays / puts the data somehwere
		c. Computational Thinkings aka - Algorithms
			i. Create a sequence of instructions to solve a problem
		d. A first program
			i. Flowcharts
				1) Creating / viewing programs
				2) Coral flowchart
					a) Learning language
			ii. A program is a list of statements
				1) Statements carry out actions
			iii. Coral
				1) For coral an interpreter runs statements
					a) Run / Execute
						i) Carry out statements
					b) Simple language for learning to program
					c) Two Versions:
						i) Flowchart
						ii) Code
			iv. Parallelogram 
				1) Input or output statement
			v. String Literal
				1) Text
				2) Double Quotes
				3) "Dogs"
			vi. Characters
				1) A-Z
				2) Symbols (!@#$)
				3) 0-9
			vii. Cursor
				1) Indicates where next output will go
			viii. Newline
				1) Two character sequence
				2) Causes the next output to move down a line
				3) Invisible in output
		e. Comments and Whitespace
			i. Comments
				1) Text a programmer puts into the code to help the understanding of the code
				2) Invisible when executing code
				3) Starts with //
					a) Includes all text on that line
				4) Must be on its own line
			ii. Whitespace
				1) Blank spaces between items within a statement 
					a) Also new lines
				2) Why it matters
					a) Cleanliness of formatting
					b) Ease of readability to the end user
					c) Precision is key in programming
		f. Bits
			i. On/Off's
				1) 1 is on, 0 is off
				2) A single bit is either one or zero
				3) Multiple bits = a byte
		g. ASCII
			i. Codes for characters in a computer
			ii. Every character (A-Z, 0-9, Symbols) has a unique identifier as a bit
			iii. 100 001 = 1 A
			iv. 010 0000 = Space
			v. Can be written as a decimal number assigned to the code as well
			vi. American standard code for information interchange
			vii. 7 bits per code
		h. Unicode
			i. More bits than ASCII
			ii. Accounts for over 100000 characters
		i. Binary
			i. Power of two
			ii. Holds 1 or 0
		j. Computing Careers
			i. Training in programming
			ii. Related fields like analytics
		k. Code and Pseudocode
			i. Pseudocode
				1) Resembles a program in a real programming language but is simplified to aid human understanding
				2) Compact 
					a) Represents programs statements summarized
				3) Informal textual description of a program
	2. Programming Summary
		a. Instructions to execute one at a time (statements)
		b. Variables hold data
		c. Flowcharts have nodes
		d. Can output a variable value, string literal 
		e. Can contain comments starting with //
		f. Most whitespace is ignored
		g. Data is in bits
			i. 1's or 0's
		h. Attention to detail is key
